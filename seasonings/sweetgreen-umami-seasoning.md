# Sweetgreen inspired umami seasoning

This recipie intends to match as closly as possible the umami seasoning that is
used in many sweetgreen toppings and dressings.

This recipie appears to change regularly, somtimes oregano and coriander seeds are added or removed. Presumably due to supply contraints.
